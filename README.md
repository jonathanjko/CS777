# CS777

# Geolife Trajectories Data Processing Project

This project is designed to extract and process Geolife Trajectories data using Spark. The project involves two main steps: data extraction and data processing, with the use of Python scripts and a Spark environment.

## Project Structure

- `CS777_DataExtraction.py`: Python script to extract Geolife Trajectories data and save it as a JSON file.
- `Final.py`: Python script to process the extracted JSON data using Spark.
- `geolife_json`: The JSON file generated by `CS777_DataExtraction.py`, used as input for the `Final.py` script.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Apache Spark
- Pandas library (`pandas`)
- PySpark library (`pyspark`)

Ensure that Spark is properly configured and available in your environment.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Extract Data

1. **Run the `CS777_DataExtraction.py` Script**

   This script processes the Geolife Trajectories data and saves it as a JSON file. Execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python CS777_DataExtraction.py

python Final.py geolife_json


### Key Points
- This README provides clear steps for extracting and processing the Geolife Trajectories data.
- It includes prerequisites, instructions for running the scripts, and information about the project structure.
- The README assumes the user has basic familiarity with running Python scripts and Spark.
